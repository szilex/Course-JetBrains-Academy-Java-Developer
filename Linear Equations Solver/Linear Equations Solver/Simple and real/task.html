<h2>Description</h2>

<p>A linear equation is called linear because it doesn't consist of variables with powers - only with variables with power 1. Linear equations can be found in different fields of science and technology. For the simplest examples, see <a target="_blank" href="https://sciencing.com/linear-equations-used-everyday-life-6022370.html" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">this</a> link. In this project, you will write a lot more powerful solver, but in this stage, you will write such a simple one.</p>

<p>Write a program that solves the equation <span class="math-tex">\(a * x = b\)</span>.</p>

<p>Numbers <span class="math-tex">\(a\)</span> and <span class="math-tex">\(b\)</span> should be read from the first line of the standard input. You should output the value <span class="math-tex">\(x\)</span>, which turns the equation to be true. For example, if the input contains numbers <span class="math-tex">\(5\)</span> and <span class="math-tex">\(3\)</span>, this means that you should interpret this as equation <span class="math-tex">\(5 * x = 3\)</span>. For this example, the answer would be <span class="math-tex">\(0.6\)</span> since <span class="math-tex">\(5 * 0.6 = 3\)</span>.</p>

<h2>Example</h2>

<p>Input:</p>

<pre><code class="language-no-highlight">5 3</code></pre>

<p>Output:</p>

<pre><code class="language-no-highlight">0.6</code></pre>
